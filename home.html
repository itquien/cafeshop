    <h1>Welcome to my cafe website </h1>
    <p>Welcome to the rich world of coffee — a story that begins with humble beans and grows into a global culture cherished by millions.</p>
    <p>
      <strong> The Origin of Coffee Beans</strong><br>
      Coffee beans aren’t actually beans — they’re the seeds of the coffee cherry, a fruit that grows on coffee plants mostly in tropical regions near the equator.
      The most popular varieties are Arabica and Robusta, each with unique flavors and growing conditions.
      Arabica beans are prized for their delicate, nuanced flavors, while Robusta beans offer a stronger, more bitter taste and higher caffeine content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legend has it that coffee was discovered in Ethiopia by a goat herder named Kaldi,
      who noticed his goats becoming energized after eating red cherries from a certain plant.
      From there, coffee traveled through the Arabian Peninsula and spread worldwide, becoming a beloved beverage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong> From Bean to Cup</strong><br>
      The journey from green coffee bean to your morning cup involves several steps:
      harvesting, processing, roasting, grinding, and brewing.
      Each step impacts the flavor and aroma, creating an endless variety of coffee experiences.
      Roasting is an art form — light roasts preserve fruity, floral notes,
      while dark roasts bring out rich, smoky flavors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong> The Culture of Coffee</strong><br>
      Coffee culture is about more than just drinking coffee — it’s about community, creativity, and ritual.
      Around the world, coffeehouses serve as social hubs, places to connect, work, or simply enjoy a quiet moment.
      From the traditional Italian espresso bar to the Japanese kissaten, coffee culture adapts to local customs and tastes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent years, specialty coffee shops have emphasized sustainability, direct trade, and artisanal brewing methods,
      turning coffee into a craft and an experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Closing</strong><br>
      Whether you savor a simple drip brew or an elaborate latte art creation, coffee connects us to nature, history, and each other.
      So the next time you sip your cup, remember the incredible journey those tiny beans have traveled — from plant to culture, and finally, to you.
